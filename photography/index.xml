      <description>My passion for birds began in high school during a summer field biology class that focused on bird banding in southwestern Missouri. While in college as a physics student, I continued to birdwatch (or simply bird) as often as I could and even took an ornithology course in my final year. More recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to the photography side of birding and bring my camera everywhere I go, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for fieldwork, a conference, or on vacation.</description>
