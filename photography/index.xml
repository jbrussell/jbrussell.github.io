      <description>My passion for birds began in high school during a bird banding field class that also first spurred my curiosity in science. As a physics major in college, I continued to bird as often as I could and took an ornithology course in my final year. Starting grad school in NYC I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have to give up &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; birding, but it turns out — like with many things — NYC is an incredible place for birdwatching.</description>
