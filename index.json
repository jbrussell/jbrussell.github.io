    "content": "  Seismic anisotropy offers perhaps the most direct observational window into convection in Earth\u0026rsquo;s mantle as well as the structure and formation of oceanic plates. The NoMelt experiment, located ~1000 km southeast of Hawaii, was designed to better understand the fundamental plate tectonic processes involved in the formation and evolution of oceanic plates by looking at a region far from complications due to upwelling or subduction.  I use surface waves from ambient seismic noise recorded on ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) at NoMelt to measure both azimuthal and polarization anisotropy. For the first time, we are able to observe the complete anisotropic complexity of surface waves, including Love wave anisotropy. This allows us to completely characterize the elastic structure of the oceanic lithosphere and compare it with handsample petrofabrics, bridging the gap between hand seismic and outcrop length scales.\n",

Nearly all seismological analyses require accurate knowledge of the instrument location. Furthermore, successful recovery of OBS from the seafloor rely on our ability to locate them. Together with Zach Eilon and Stephen Mosher, I have developed a new open-source tool called OBSrange for locating ocean bottom seismometers on the seafloor and providing statistically robust uncertainties. We applied the tool to data from the 2018 Young Pacific ORCA deployment, revealing a clockwise mesoscale eddy that correlates with observed ocean currents in the region. This novel measurement of depth integrated flow through the water column is the first of its kind and could potentially be used to calibrate models of vertical shear.\n   Fig 2.

If the earthquake is large enough, the Earth can \u0026lsquo;ring\u0026rsquo; for days or weeks. This video demonstrates both visually and sonically these free oscillations of the Earth after the M6.9 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Fiji on 2/24/2017.\nThe video is composed of three separate but related animations. Each animation show how the waves travel along the surface of the earth, displayed as a circular ring. This 2-dimensional ring is made up of 2,000 points on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface that display ground motion for 48 hours after the earthquake.\nAnimation 1: Surface waves    Fig 1. Drift patterns of the 30 OBS of the 2018 Young Pacific Orca deployment. A clockwise mesoscale gyre can be observed that correlates in space and time with geostrophic flow patterns.     Animation 2: Surface waves    Fig 2. Drift patterns of the 30 OBS of the 2018 Young Pacific Orca deployment.

After a large earthquake, waves bounce around inside the earth for hours and sometimes days. These audio-visualizations show how these waves travel along the surface of the earth, displayed as a ring. This 2-dimensional ring is made up of 2,000 points on the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface that display ground motion after an earthquake.\nAudiovisual of the M6.9 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Fiji on 2/24/2017.\nVISUAL: Synthetic seismograms were generated at 2000 points on the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface using Instaseis. Both the vertical (Z) and radial \u0026reg; components are visualized, resulting in elliptical patterns. Can you spot the Rayleigh waves?\nAUDIO: We are listening to the antipode (bottom of the circle) where our \u0026ldquo;microphone\u0026rdquo; is denoted by the red circle. The seismogram at the antipode is sonified using a new resynthesis technique that captures frequency content of the waveform more accurately than direct sonification.\nAudiovisual demonstration where traveling waves are generated by the sum of many standing waves (normal modes) at the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface.\nVIDEO: shows 9 of Earth\u0026rsquo;s observable lowest frequency normal modes (color rings) with tones corresponding to the center frequency of each mode. Higher frequency modes are represented by cool colors and low frequencies by warm colors. The outer ring (white) represents the sum of the colored rings. Can you spot the waves traveling through the ring?\nAUDIO: The loudness of each tone is modulated by its amplitude envelope. Notice how the chord evolves over time as the higher frequencies die away.\n",

    "summary": "Observations of seismic anisotropy in ocean basins are important for constraining deformation and melting processes in the upper mantle. The NoMelt OBS array was deployed on relatively pristine, 70-Ma seafloor in the central Pacific with the aim of constraining upper-mantle circulation and the evolution of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Azimuthal variations in Rayleigh-wave velocity suggest strong anisotropic fabric both in the lithosphere and deep in the asthenosphere, and we aim to evaluate whether radial anisotropy shows a similar pattern. We use a combination of Love waves from earthquakes (20-100 s) as well as high-frequency ambient noise (5-10 s) to estimate Vsh in the upper 300 km beneath the NoMelt array. Waveform fitting of the ambient-noise cross spectra provide phase-velocity estimates that are sensitive to the upper ~50 km of the mantle. To constrain structure beneath the lid, we employ an array-based approach to measure Love-wave phase velocities across the array using seven shallow-focus events (60 s) are mostly dominated by fundamental mode energy. Through forward modeling of Love wave Fréchet kernels, we find an extremely strong nonlinearity in individual mode-branch sensitivity that is dependent on the relative velocity difference between the low-velocity zone (LVZ) and the overlying Pacific lid. For the fundamental mode in the presence of a strong LVZ, intermediate periods (20-50 s) have little sensitivity within the lithospheric mantle with peak sensitivity pushed to the base of the LVZ. This peak sensitivity migrates to much shallower depth as the lid/LVZ contrast is reduced. Therefore, we use a Monte Carlo approach to systematically explore the model space and identify the most robust model features required to minimize phase-velocity misfit of the full multimode Love wave arrivals. The resulting Vsh model is combined with the NoMelt Vsv model to obtain estimates of radial anisotropy for the top 300km of the central Pacific upper-mantle.",
