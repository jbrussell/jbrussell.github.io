    "summary": "We determine the mantle attenuation (1/Qμ) structure beneath 70 Myr seafloor in the central Pacific. We use long-period (33-100 sec) Rayleigh waves recorded by the NoMelt array of broadband ocean-bottom seismometers. After the removal of tilt and compliance noise, we are able to measure Rayleigh wave phase and amplitude for 125 earthquakes. The compliance correction for ocean wave pressure on the seafloor is particularly important for improving signal-to-noise at periods longer than 55 sec. Attenuation and azimuthally anisotropic phase velocity in the study area are determined by approximating the wavefield as the interference of two plane waves. We find that the amplitude decay of Rayleigh waves across the NoMelt array can be adequately explained using a two-layer model: Q μ = 1400 in the shallow layer, Q μ = 110 in the deeper layer, and a transition depth at 70 km, although the sharpness of the transition is not well resolved by the Rayleigh wave data. Notably, Qμ observed in the NoMelt lithosphere is significantly higher than values in this area from global attenuation models. When compared with lithospheric Qμ measured at higher frequency (∼3 Hz), the frequency dependence of attenuation is very slight, revising previous interpretations. The effect of anelasticity on shear velocity (VS) is estimated from the ratio of observed velocity to the predicted anharmonic value. We use laboratory-based parameters to predict attenuation and velocity-dispersion spectra that result from the superposition of a weakly frequency dependent high-temperature background and an absorption peak. We test a large range of frequencies for the position of the absorption peak ($f_e$) and determine, at each depth, which values of fe predict Qμ and VS that can fit the NoMelt Qμ and VS values simultaneously. We show that between depths of 60 and 80 km the seismic models require an increase in fe by at least 3-4 orders of magnitude. Under the assumption that the absorption peak is caused by elastically accommodated grain-boundary sliding, this increase in fe reflects a decrease in grain-boundary viscosity of 3-4 orders of magnitude. A likely explanation is an increase in the water content of the mantle, with the base of the dehydrated lid located at ∼70-km depth.",

    "content": " Introduction At a broad scale, evolution of the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system follows a relatively simple half-space cooling model with a rigid plate overlying weaker asthenosphere that thickens with distance from the ridge. However, in detail observations such as seafloor shallowing relative to half-space cooling at ages \u0026gt;70 Ma and seafloor gravity lineations suggest deviations from this simple model. One candidate to explain these observations is small-scale convection, which has been proposed in the form of so-called \u0026ldquo;Richter rolls\u0026rdquo;. These convective cells are estimated to be ~200 km in diameter and bring hot material toward the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface.\nThe YoungORCA experiment The YoungORCA project consists of an array of 30 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and aims to directly image small-scale convection. Located at ~40 Ma seafloor in the south Pacific, the array sits on distinct gravity undulations of ~200 km wavelength that may indicate convective cells in the current-day asthenosphere.  Map of the YoungORCA array with high-pass filtered free-air gravity anomaly in the background. Note the northwest-southeast trending gravity anomalies.  \nMy research utilizes surface waves (Rayleigh and Love) to investigate the physical, chemical, and thermal structure of the uppermost mantle beneath the array. These waves range in sensitivity from the crust down to ~300 km depth in the uppermost asthenosphere. From surface-wave observations of phase velocity, we constrain the shear velocity structure in the upper mantle, as well as seismic anisotropy.\nPreliminary findings We find evidence for small-scale convection beneath the YoungORCA array. Seismic anisotropy in the asthensophere reveals a fast direction rotated significantly (~25º) from the absolute plate motion (APM) direction, at odds with the predicted large-scale mantle circulation pattern. This clockwise rotation in anisotropy relative to APM may be explained by pressure-drive flow associated with the South Pacific Superswell. As hot mantle material upwells and impinges on the lithosphere, mantle should flow radially away from the plume head, producing a secondary flow direction that is consistent with what we observe.\n Elastic structure of the uppermantle beneath the YoungORCA array. Seismic anisotropy in the asthenosphere is rotated from the absolute plate motion, indicating small-scale convection.   ",

    "summary": "Seismic anisotropy of the oceanic lithosphere offers a window into mid-ocean ridge processes, lithosphere evolution, and the state of Earth's upper mantle. Natural and laboratory olivine samples deformed under various conditions exhibit a range of lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) fabrics that provide a direct link between seismic observables and upper mantle conditions. However, interpreting seismic anisotropy in the context of LPO fabric data has proven challenging due to incomplete seismic constraints and vast differences in length scale. Here, we bridge this gap by estimating the complete orthorhombic elastic tensor of unperturbed ~70 Ma Pacific lithosphere directly beneath the Moho using high-resolution ocean bottom seismic observations sensitive to Vp and Vs anisotropy. We then utilize natural and laboratory petrofabrics from the literature to infer LPO fabric type and shear strain accumulated within the shallow lithosphere. Our findings indicate alternative (D-type) fabric and high strain accumulation (400%) in the oceanic lithosphere, challenging conventional assumptions of the prevalence of A-type fabric and suggesting D-type may be more ubiquitous in oceanic lithosphere than previously thought. Furthermore, D-type fabric indicates a dehydrated lithosphere and deformation by dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (DisGBS) near the ridge. This study represents a first in situ estimate of fabric type and strain accumulation in the oceanic lithosphere that will inform future geodynamic modeling of LPO evolution in ocean basins.",

    "summary": "Reliable instrument recoverability and data quality rely on accurate estimates of instrument locations on the seafloor. However, freely available software for this estimation does not currently exist. We present OBSrange, an open-source tool for robustly locating ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) on the seafloor using acoustic transponder ranging data. Available in both MATLAB and Python (see Data and Resources), the algorithm inverts two-way acoustic ranging travel-time data for instrument location, depth, and average water sound speed with the ability to accurately account for ship velocity, ray refraction through the water column specific to the region, and a known lateral offset between the ship’s Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and acoustic transponder. The tool provides comprehensive estimates of model parameter uncertainty including bootstrap uncertainties for all four parameters as well as an F-test grid search providing a 3D confidence ellipsoid around each station. \n\n We validate the tool using a synthetic travel-time dataset and find average horizontal location errors on the order of ∼4 m for an instrument at 5000 m depth. An exploration of survey geometries shows significant variation in location precision depending on the pattern chosen. We explore the trade-off between survey length and location uncertainty to quantitatively inform cruise planning strategies. The optimal survey radius for resolving instrument location depends on water depth and desired precision and nominally ranges from 0.75–1 nautical mile (NM) at 5000 m water depth to ∼0.25 NM at 500 m depth. Radial legs toward and away from the instrument are crucial for resolving the depth-water velocity trade-off, and thus circle surveys should be avoided. Line surveys, common for active source experiments, are unable to resolve the instrument location orthogonal to the survey line. \n\n We apply our tool to the 2018 Young Pacific OBS Research into Convecting Asthenosphere (ORCA) deployment in the south Pacific yielding an average root mean square data misfit of 1.96 ms with an average instrument drift of ∼170 m. Observed drifts reveal a clockwise rotation pattern of ∼500 km diameter that resembles a cyclonic mesoscale gyre observed in the geostrophic flow field, suggesting a potential application of accurate instrument drifts as a novel proxy for depth-integrated flow through the water column.",

    "summary": "The eastern North American margin (ENAM) formed during the breakup of Pangaea 175–200 Ma, recording the onset of rifting. The ENAM Community Seismic Experiment (2014–2015) consisted of an onshore/offshore broadband and short-period ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) deployment aimed at better characterizing this relatively understudied region. In this study, we utilize the 28 ENAM broadband OBS to measure Rayleigh-wave phase velocities from ambient-noise (15-40 s period) and teleseisms (40-150 s). Tilt noise is especially high due to the Gulf Stream current; thus, tilt is removed from the vertical component of both teleseismic and ambient-noise waveforms. We observe Rayleigh-wave azimuthal anisotropy of ~2–3% from 15-40 s period with margin-parallel fast directions, orthogonal to predictions of olivine alignment generated by corner-flow at the paleo-ridge. Previous shear-wave splitting observations showed similar margin-parallel splitting, which was attributed to present-day margin-parallel asthenospheric flow. Our measurements are mostly sensitive to the lithosphere, suggesting that this signal is not purely due to present-day asthenospheric flow, but instead, is embedded in the fossilized fabric of the oceanic lithosphere. This observation has implications for the mantle flow field during and immediately after the rifting of Pangaea and subsequent opening of the Atlantic Ocean.",

    "summary": "Lithospheric seismic anisotropy illuminates mid-ocean ridge dynamics and the thermal evolution of oceanic plates. We utilize short-period (5–7.5 s) ambient-noise surface waves and 15- to 150-s Rayleigh waves measured across the NoMelt ocean-bottom array to invert for the complete radial and azimuthal anisotropy in the upper ∼35 km of ∼70-Ma Pacific lithospheric mantle, and azimuthal anisotropy through the underlying asthenosphere. Strong azimuthal variations in Rayleigh- and Love-wave velocity are observed, including the first clearly measured Love-wave 2𝜃 and 4𝜃 variations. Inversion of averaged dispersion requires radial anisotropy in the shallow mantle (2-3%) and the lower crust (4-5%), with horizontal velocities (Vsh) faster than vertical velocities (Vsv). Azimuthal anisotropy is strong in the mantle, with 4.5–6% 2𝜃 variation in VSV with fast propagation parallel to the fossil-spreading direction (FSD), and 2–2.5% 4𝜃 variation in Vsh with a fast direction 45º from FSD. The relative behavior of 2𝜃, 4𝜃, and radial anisotropy in the mantle are consistent with ophiolite petrofabrics, linking outcrop and surface-wave length scales. Vsv remains fast parallel to FSD to ∼80km depth where the direction changes, suggesting spreading-dominated deformation at the ridge. The transition at ∼80 km perhaps marks the dehydration boundary and base of the lithosphere. Azimuthal anisotropy strength increases from the Moho to ∼30 km depth, consistent with flow models of passive upwelling at the ridge. Strong azimuthal anisotropy suggests extremely coherent olivine fabric. Weaker radial anisotropy implies slightly nonhorizontal fabric or the presence of alternative (so-called E-type) peridotite fabric. Presence of radial anisotropy in the crust suggests subhorizontal layering and/or shearing during crustal accretion.",

    "content": " This video is a contribution by Celia Eddy and I to the Seismic Sound Lab, run by Ben Holtzman at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n After a large earthquake, the Earth vibrates like waves on a guitar string \u0026ndash; These discrete modes of vibration are called normal modes or free oscillations. If the earthquake is large enough, the Earth can \u0026lsquo;ring\u0026rsquo; for days or weeks. This video uses synthetic waveform simulations to demonstrate both visually and sonically these free oscillations of the Earth after the M6.9 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Fiji on 2/24/2017.\nThe video is composed of three separate-but-related animations. Each animation show how the waves travel along the surface of the earth, displayed as a circular ring. This 2-dimensional ring is made up of 2,000 points on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface that display ground motion for 48 hours after the earthquake.\nAnimation 1: Surface and Body Waves We are listening to a waveform at the antipode of the Earth from the M6.9 in Fiji. The synthetic waveforms are calculated using Instaseis. To make the sound, many narrow band filters are used to decompose the seismic waveform into its constituent frequency components (Fig. 1). Each individual waveform is then assigned to an oscillator of a specific frequency.\n Narrow band filtered seismograms.   Animation 2: Normal Modes The first 8 gravest (lowest frequency) spheroidal modes are extracted from 48 hour seismograms (Fig. 2). This animation shows the shapes of these modes in color and the superposition of the modes in white, starting from the lowest frequency and incrementally adding higher modes. Each mode is mapped to a tone that we can hear, where the relative frequencies of the tones are preserved. By the end of the animation, you can begin to see surface waves propagating back and forth.\n Discrete frequencies for the 8 gravest modes.   Animation 3: Attenuation This animation is similar to Animation 2 except this time, all the modes are played at once. The tone of each mode is modulated in time by the amplitude envelopes in Fig. 3. Through time, the high frequencies die out due to anelastic attenuation and all that is left are the lowest frequency modes. In this video, you can actually hear this attenuation!\n Amplitude envelopes for each of the modes in Fig 2.   ",

East Coast Magnetic Anomaly (ECMA); Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly (BSMA); Inner Magnetic Quiet Zone (IMQZ); Outer Magnetic Quiet Zone (OMQZ).   The eastern north American margin (ENAM) formed during the early breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea ~200 Ma. Therefore, the structure of this passive margin holds the keys to understanding continental breakup. The ENAM Community Seismic Experiment (ENAM-CSE) consisted of an active source seismic experiment as well as a deployment of 28 broadband ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) from April 2014 \u0026ndash; May 2015 that aim to answer these questions.\nMy research involves using ambient noise Rayleigh waves to image the relic flow patterns recorded in the lithosphere during continental breakup. We find azimuthal anisotropy with the fast direction parallel to the coastline, 90º rotated from the paleo-spreading direction. This is at odds with the commonly accepted idea that the lithosphere records anisotropy parallel to the paleo-spreading direction. Our observations may be indicative of margin-parallel flow during the continental breakup. Alternatively, fast translation of the overall system relative to the slower breakup could have caused overprinting of the spreading signal by the plate motion signal.\n Seismic anisotropy from the ENAM experiment. Fast directions are parallel to the margin rather than the paleo-spreading direction.   ",

    "summary": "The frozen-in lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine in oceanic lithosphere provides insight into paleo-ridge dynamics as well as subsequent thermal evolution of the plate. Elastic properties of peridotites from ocean environments offer direct observations of lithospheric LPO fabric but rely on assumptions about the structural reference frame of the sample. In situ petrofabric constraints free of reference-frame assumptions require high-resolution, co-located compressional- and shear-wave observations that probe the full elastic behavior of the lithosphere. Using high-frequency (5–7.5 s) Rayleigh and Love waves and active-source Pn sampling 65-75 Ma Pacific lithosphere, we solve for shear and compressional velocities and anisotropy, directly constraining 9 elastic parameters in the upper ~25 km of the lithosphere. Observations of the 4θ azimuthal variability of Love-wave velocities yield the first local constraints on E. Scaling relations derived from oceanic peridotites from the literature provide the remaining 4 parameters, resulting in the first in situ estimate of the complete elastic tensor for oceanic lithosphere. We find strong azimuthal anisotropy with G (4–6%) and B (6–6.5%) parallel to the fossil-spreading direction (FSD) and E (~2.5%) parallel to FSD + 45º, consistent with oceanic peridotites and elastic models of olivine. The magnitude of G and B suggest nearly complete alignment of fabric observed at the hand-sample scale, and G is parallel to the FSD down to ~80 km depth, implying that corner flow dominates near-ridge deformation pattern approximately to the base of the melting zone. Relatively weak radial anisotropy is observed in the lithosphere with Vsh  Vsv by ~2%. We calculate all 13 parameters of the equivalent elastic stiffness tensor, Cij, and the combination of strong azimuthal anisotropy and weak radial anisotropy results in either E-type LPO fabric or A-type fabric with the fast axis ([100]) rotated out of the shear plane. We will discuss the implication of these fabrics for models of mid-ocean ridge dynamics.",
