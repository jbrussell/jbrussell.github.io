    "content": "   Seismic anisotropy offers perhaps the most direct observational window into convection in Earth\u0026rsquo;s mantle as well as the structure and formation of oceanic plates. The NoMelt experiment, located ~1000 km southeast of Hawaii, was designed to better understand the fundamental plate tectonic processes involved in the formation and evolution of oceanic plates by looking at a region far from complications due to upwelling or subduction.  I use surface waves from ambient seismic noise recorded on ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) at NoMelt to measure both azimuthal and polarization anisotropy. For the first time, we are able to observe the complete anisotropic complexity of surface waves, including Love wave anisotropy. This allows us to completely characterize the elastic structure of the oceanic lithosphere and compare it with handsample petrofabrics.\nComparing to Petrofabrics By measuring the complete set of anisotropic parameters for both Rayleigh and Love waves, we can for the first time compare the seismically derived elastic behavior of oceanic lithosphere with that directly measured from lithospheric rocks. We find excellent agreement in the anisotropic terms (see below) suggesting that we have truly bridged the gap between surface-wave and handsample length scales.\n   Comparison of the NoMelt anisotropic behavior from our study in black, versus three handsample petrofabrics in color.

Nearly all seismological analyses require accurate knowledge of the instrument location. Furthermore, successful recovery of OBS from the seafloor rely on our ability to locate them. Together with Zach Eilon and Stephen Mosher, I have developed a new open-source tool called OBSrange for locating ocean bottom seismometers on the seafloor and providing statistically robust uncertainties. We applied the tool to data from the 2018 Young Pacific ORCA deployment, revealing a clockwise mesoscale eddy that correlates with observed ocean currents in the region. This novel measurement of depth integrated flow through the water column is the first of its kind and could potentially be used to calibrate models of vertical shear.\n   Fig 2.

    "content": " This video is a contribution by Celia Eddy and I to the Seismic Sound Lab, run by Ben Holtzman at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n After a large earthquake, the Earth vibrates like waves on a guitar string \u0026ndash; These discrete modes of vibration are called normal modes or free oscillations. If the earthquake is large enough, the Earth can \u0026lsquo;ring\u0026rsquo; for days or weeks. This video uses synthetic waveform simulations to demonstrate both visually and sonically these free oscillations of the Earth after the M6.9 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Fiji on 2/24/2017.\nThe video is composed of three separate-but-related animations. Each animation show how the waves travel along the surface of the earth, displayed as a circular ring. This 2-dimensional ring is made up of 2,000 points on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface that display ground motion for 48 hours after the earthquake.\nAnimation 1: Surface and Body Waves We are listening to a waveform at the antipode of the Earth from the M6.9 in Fiji. The synthetic waveforms are calculated using Instaseis. To make the sound, many narrow band filters are used to decompose the seismic waveform into its constituent frequency components (Fig. 1). Each individual waveform is then assigned to an oscillator of a specific frequency.    Fig 1. Narrow band filtered seismograms.    \nAnimation 2: Normal Modes The first 8 gravest (lowest frequency) spheroidal modes are extracted from 48 hour seismograms (Fig. 2). This animation shows the shapes of these modes in color and the superposition of the modes in white, starting from the lowest frequency and incrementally adding higher modes. Each mode is mapped to a tone that we can hear, where the relative frequencies of the tones are preserved. By the end of the animation, you can begin to see surface waves propagating back and forth.\n   Fig 2. Discrete frequencies for the 8 gravest modes.     Animation 3: Attenuation This animation is similar to Animation 2 except this time, all the modes are played at once. The tone of each mode is modulated in time by the amplitude envelopes in Fig. 3. Through time, the high frequencies die out due to anelastic attenuation and all that is left are the lowest frequency modes. In this video, you can actually hear this attenuation!    Fig 3. Amplitude envelopes from each of the modes from Fig 2.    \n",

    "summary": "Observations of seismic anisotropy in ocean basins are important for constraining deformation and melting processes in the upper mantle. The NoMelt OBS array was deployed on relatively pristine, 70-Ma seafloor in the central Pacific with the aim of constraining upper-mantle circulation and the evolution of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. Azimuthal variations in Rayleigh-wave velocity suggest strong anisotropic fabric both in the lithosphere and deep in the asthenosphere, and we aim to evaluate whether radial anisotropy shows a similar pattern. We use a combination of Love waves from earthquakes (20-100 s) as well as high-frequency ambient noise (5-10 s) to estimate Vsh in the upper 300 km beneath the NoMelt array. Waveform fitting of the ambient-noise cross spectra provide phase-velocity estimates that are sensitive to the upper ~50 km of the mantle. To constrain structure beneath the lid, we employ an array-based approach to measure Love-wave phase velocities across the array using seven shallow-focus events (60 s) are mostly dominated by fundamental mode energy. Through forward modeling of Love wave Fréchet kernels, we find an extremely strong nonlinearity in individual mode-branch sensitivity that is dependent on the relative velocity difference between the low-velocity zone (LVZ) and the overlying Pacific lid. For the fundamental mode in the presence of a strong LVZ, intermediate periods (20-50 s) have little sensitivity within the lithospheric mantle with peak sensitivity pushed to the base of the LVZ. This peak sensitivity migrates to much shallower depth as the lid/LVZ contrast is reduced. Therefore, we use a Monte Carlo approach to systematically explore the model space and identify the most robust model features required to minimize phase-velocity misfit of the full multimode Love wave arrivals. The resulting Vsh model is combined with the NoMelt Vsv model to obtain estimates of radial anisotropy for the top 300km of the central Pacific upper-mantle.",
