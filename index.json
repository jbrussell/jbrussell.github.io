    "summary": "Seismic anisotropy of the oceanic lithosphere offers a window into mid-ocean ridge processes, lithosphere evolution, and the state of Earth's upper mantle. Natural and laboratory olivine samples deformed under various conditions exhibit a range of lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) fabrics that provide a direct link between seismic observables and upper mantle conditions. However, interpreting seismic anisotropy in the context of LPO fabric data has proven challenging due to incomplete seismic constraints and vast differences in length scale. Here, we bridge this gap by estimating the complete orthorhombic elastic tensor of unperturbed ~70 Ma Pacific lithosphere directly beneath the Moho using high-resolution ocean bottom seismic observations sensitive to Vp and Vs anisotropy. We then utilize natural and laboratory petrofabrics from the literature to infer LPO fabric type and shear strain accumulated within the shallow lithosphere. Our findings indicate alternative (D-type) fabric and high strain accumulation (400%) in the oceanic lithosphere, challenging conventional assumptions of the prevalence of A-type fabric and suggesting D-type may be more ubiquitous in oceanic lithosphere than previously thought. Furthermore, D-type fabric indicates a dehydrated lithosphere and deformation by dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (DisGBS) near the ridge. This study represents a first in situ estimate of fabric type and strain accumulation in the oceanic lithosphere that will inform future geodynamic modeling of LPO evolution in ocean basins.",

    "summary": "Observations of seismic anisotropy in the ocean basins provide key constraints on present-day asthenospheric flow as well as relic fabric recorded in the lithosphere during its formation near the ridge. The international collaboration PacificArray seeks to advance understanding of the Pacific lithosphere-asthenosphere system using focused ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) arrays. A particular goal of this initiative is to elucidate the extent and role played by small-scale convection (SSC) in plate and asthenosphere evolution. Here, we present initial results from the Young ORCA (OBS Research into Convecting Asthenosphere) array, consisting of 30 broadband OBS situated on ~40 Ma seafloor in the south Pacific. We measure ambient-noise Rayleigh- and Love-wave phase velocities from 5–25 s and 3–9 s period, respectively. Fundamental mode Rayleigh waves are observed from 14–25 s period. At shorter periods (5–10 s), we isolate the first-overtone Rayleigh wave from the fundamental-mode water-column arrival by removing the coherent pressure signal from the vertical channel. Love-wave mode content is fundamental mode at periods ",

The NoMelt experiment, located ~1000 km southeast of Hawaii, was designed to better understand the fundamental plate tectonic processes involved in the formation and evolution of oceanic plates by looking at a region far from complications due to upwelling or subduction.  We use surface waves from ambient seismic noise recorded on ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) at NoMelt to measure both azimuthal and polarization anisotropy. For the first time, we are able to observe the complete anisotropic complexity of surface waves, including Love wave anisotropy. This allows us to completely characterize the elastic structure of the oceanic lithosphere and compare it with handsample petrofabrics.\nComparing to Petrofabrics By measuring the complete set of anisotropic parameters for both Rayleigh and Love waves, we can for the first time compare the seismically derived elastic behavior of oceanic lithosphere with that directly measured from lithospheric rocks. We find excellent agreement in the anisotropic terms (see below) suggesting that we have truly bridged the gap between surface-wave and handsample length scales.\n Comparison of the NoMelt anisotropic behavior from our study in black, versus three handsample petrofabrics in color.

Nearly all seismological analyses require accurate knowledge of the instrument location. Furthermore, successful recovery of OBS from the seafloor rely on our ability to locate them. Together with Zach Eilon and Stephen Mosher, we have developed a new open-source tool called OBSrange for locating ocean bottom seismometers on the seafloor and providing statistically robust uncertainties. We applied the tool to data from the 2018 Young Pacific ORCA deployment, revealing a clockwise mesoscale eddy that correlates with observed ocean currents in the region.

    "content": " This video is a contribution by Celia Eddy and I to the Seismic Sound Lab, run by Ben Holtzman at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\n After a large earthquake, the Earth vibrates like waves on a guitar string \u0026ndash; These discrete modes of vibration are called normal modes or free oscillations. If the earthquake is large enough, the Earth can \u0026lsquo;ring\u0026rsquo; for days or weeks. This video uses synthetic waveform simulations to demonstrate both visually and sonically these free oscillations of the Earth after the M6.9 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Fiji on 2/24/2017.\nThe video is composed of three separate-but-related animations. Each animation show how the waves travel along the surface of the earth, displayed as a circular ring. This 2-dimensional ring is made up of 2,000 points on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface that display ground motion for 48 hours after the earthquake.\nAnimation 1: Surface and Body Waves We are listening to a waveform at the antipode of the Earth from the M6.9 in Fiji. The synthetic waveforms are calculated using Instaseis. To make the sound, many narrow band filters are used to decompose the seismic waveform into its constituent frequency components (Fig. 1). Each individual waveform is then assigned to an oscillator of a specific frequency.\n Narrow band filtered seismograms.   Animation 2: Normal Modes The first 8 gravest (lowest frequency) spheroidal modes are extracted from 48 hour seismograms (Fig. 2). This animation shows the shapes of these modes in color and the superposition of the modes in white, starting from the lowest frequency and incrementally adding higher modes. Each mode is mapped to a tone that we can hear, where the relative frequencies of the tones are preserved. By the end of the animation, you can begin to see surface waves propagating back and forth.\n Discrete frequencies for the 8 gravest modes.   Animation 3: Attenuation This animation is similar to Animation 2 except this time, all the modes are played at once. The tone of each mode is modulated in time by the amplitude envelopes in Fig. 3. Through time, the high frequencies die out due to anelastic attenuation and all that is left are the lowest frequency modes. In this video, you can actually hear this attenuation!\n Amplitude envelopes for each of the modes in Fig 2.   ",

    "summary": "The frozen-in lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine in oceanic lithosphere provides insight into paleo-ridge dynamics as well as subsequent thermal evolution of the plate. Elastic properties of peridotites from ocean environments offer direct observations of lithospheric LPO fabric but rely on assumptions about the structural reference frame of the sample. In situ petrofabric constraints free of reference-frame assumptions require high-resolution, co-located compressional- and shear-wave observations that probe the full elastic behavior of the lithosphere. Using high-frequency (5–7.5 s) Rayleigh and Love waves and active-source Pn sampling 65-75 Ma Pacific lithosphere, we solve for shear and compressional velocities and anisotropy, directly constraining 9 elastic parameters in the upper ~25 km of the lithosphere. Observations of the 4θ azimuthal variability of Love-wave velocities yield the first local constraints on E. Scaling relations derived from oceanic peridotites from the literature provide the remaining 4 parameters, resulting in the first in situ estimate of the complete elastic tensor for oceanic lithosphere. We find strong azimuthal anisotropy with G (4–6%) and B (6–6.5%) parallel to the fossil-spreading direction (FSD) and E (~2.5%) parallel to FSD + 45º, consistent with oceanic peridotites and elastic models of olivine. The magnitude of G and B suggest nearly complete alignment of fabric observed at the hand-sample scale, and G is parallel to the FSD down to ~80 km depth, implying that corner flow dominates near-ridge deformation pattern approximately to the base of the melting zone. Relatively weak radial anisotropy is observed in the lithosphere with Vsh  Vsv by ~2%. We calculate all 13 parameters of the equivalent elastic stiffness tensor, Cij, and the combination of strong azimuthal anisotropy and weak radial anisotropy results in either E-type LPO fabric or A-type fabric with the fast axis ([100]) rotated out of the shear plane. We will discuss the implication of these fabrics for models of mid-ocean ridge dynamics.",
