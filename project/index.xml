      <title>Young ORCA: Searching for small-scale convection in the south Pacific</title>

      <description>Introduction At a broad scale, evolution of the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system follows a relatively simple half-space cooling model with a rigid plate overlying weaker asthenosphere that thickens with distance from the ridge. However, in detail observations such as seafloor shallowing relative to half-space cooling at ages &amp;gt;70 Ma and seafloor gravity lineations suggest deviations from this simple model. One candidate to explain these observations is small-scale convection, which has been proposed in the form of so-called &amp;ldquo;Richter rolls&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>NoMelt: seismic constraints on oceanic lithosphere petrofabric</title>

      <description>Seismic anisotropy offers perhaps the most direct observational window into convection in Earth&amp;rsquo;s mantle as well as the structure and formation of oceanic plates. The NoMelt experiment, located ~1000 km southeast of Hawaii, was designed to better understand the fundamental plate tectonic processes involved in the formation and evolution of oceanic plates by looking at a region far from complications due to upwelling or subduction.  We use surface waves from ambient seismic noise recorded on ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) at NoMelt to measure both azimuthal and polarization anisotropy.</description>

      <title>OBSrange: A new tool for the precise location of ocean bottom seismometers</title>

      <description>Schematic showing the ranging procedure for locating ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) on the seafloor [Russell et al., 2018].   Nearly all seismological analyses require accurate knowledge of the instrument location. Furthermore, successful recovery of OBS from the seafloor rely on our ability to locate them. Together with Zach Eilon and Stephen Mosher, we have developed a new open-source tool called OBSrange for locating ocean bottom seismometers on the seafloor and providing statistically robust uncertainties.</description>

      <title>ENAM: Seismic anisotropy of the Eastern North American Margin</title>

      <description>Magnetic anomalies of the ENAM-CSE region with broadband OBS shown as circles and colored by depth. East Coast Magnetic Anomaly (ECMA); Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly (BSMA); Inner Magnetic Quiet Zone (IMQZ); Outer Magnetic Quiet Zone (OMQZ).   The eastern north American margin (ENAM) formed during the early breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea ~200 Ma. Therefore, the structure of this passive margin holds the keys to understanding continental breakup.</description>
