      <title>Exploring Earthquake Magnitude and Depth</title>
      <link>https://jbrussell.github.io/eilive2020/part1a3_magnitudedepth/</link>

      <description>Magnitude and depth are two basic features of an earthquake that are important for understanding plate tectonics as well as earthquake hazard. Typically, the shallower the earthquake and larger the magnitude, the more potential for destruction.
In the two interactive figures below, we will explore relationships between earthquake magnitude and depth using what&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;linking and brushing&amp;rdquo;. Selecting data in one figure will highlight the corresponding points in the other.</description>

      <description>Hundreds of earthquakes occur across the globe every day, but most of them are too small for us to feel. Here, we will dive into earthquake data and explore some of the larger magnitude earthquakes (greater than M5.0) that have occurred over the past several years.
We start by looking at where earthquakes occur spatially. The interactive map below shows the past 5 years of earthquakes, where each circle represents a single earthquake.</description>

      <title>Making Your Own Maps With trinket.io</title>
      <link>https://jbrussell.github.io/eilive2020/part1a2_makeyourown/</link>

      <guid>https://jbrussell.github.io/eilive2020/part1a2_makeyourown/</guid>
      <description>Now we will use trinket.io to make our own earthquake maps with Python. Trinkets allow you to run snippets of Python code directly in your internet browser! Just click the  button in the top bar to run the code.

Starting simple Our first example is a simple sinusoid with frequency $f$ and amplitude $A$:
$$ y = A \sin (f x) $$
Try making changes to the code and rerunning it to see how the output changes.</description>

      <title>Seismic Noise in New York City</title>
      <link>https://jbrussell.github.io/eilive2020/part1b_seismicnoisenyc/</link>

      <description>Anyone who has been to New York City knows it can be a noisy place. The same goes for the ground beneath our feet as cars, trucks, buses, and subways rumble by. Extremely sensitive seismometers that measure ground motion can detect these vibrations. Due to the COVID-19 crisis and the resulting shelter-in-place protocols active around the world, seismic noise has noticeably decreased worldwide.
Shown below is data from a seismometer currently installed in Central Park as part of the Lamont-Doherty Cooperative Seismographic Network (LCSN).</description>
