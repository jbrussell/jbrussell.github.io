# 45 Years of Earthquake Data

Next, we gather all available data for earthquakes larger than M5.0 from the past nearly 45 years (1976â€“2020) from the [USGS catalogue](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/) and the [GCMT Project](https://www.globalcmt.org/). 

This would be far too many points to interactively load into your web browser (more than 26,000 earthquakes), so here we are using a tool that gathers the data within pixels on the map and counts how many earthquakes occur in each. We can think of this as earthquake density as indicated by the color: dark colored points have few or no earthquakes and bright colors show regions with many earthquakes. In this view, you can clearly see the boundaries of the tectonic plates!
